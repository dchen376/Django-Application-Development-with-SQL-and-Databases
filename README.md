# Django-Application-Development-with-SQL-and-Databases
This is a 5-week IBM course offered via Coursera

### Week1 - Getting started with SQL & Relational Databases

What is data? As you start this course, you will be introduced to concepts fundamental to understanding data, databases, and database management systems. You will learn some basic SQL statements. Explore the structure, use cases, and limitations of relational databases. Learn key relational database concepts, including entities, attributes, entity-relationship data modeling, common data types, and primary key. You will learn about cloud database fundamentals and get hands-on experience creating a database instance on the cloud. At the end of the module, an optional lesson with more advanced SQL techniques will help you get the most out of your data.
##### Learning Objectives
- Write basic SQL statements
- Describe relational databases
- Discuss the use cases and limitations of relational databases.
- Define data and databases
- Describe relational database concepts such as entities, attributes, entity-relationship models, and primary key
- Define non-relational databases and their characteristics.
- Create a database instance on the Cloud
- Provide the syntax and examples for the following SQL statements: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE

### Week2 - ORM: Bridging the Gap Between the Real World and Relational Model

You’re aware that SQL is a powerful tool for working with databases. But in the modern application development environment, object-oriented programming is the most popular paradigm, and it is quite different from SQL. Is there a way to use Object-oriented programming to work with databases? Discover how Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) bridges the gap between object-oriented programming (OOP) and SQL and allows application developers to use OOP languages to work with databases without writing SQL code. Gain skills in using Django ORM, a popular ORM library for Python, to define models and fields so they can be mapped to database tables. Learn the steps for using Django ORM to convert your entity-relationship diagrams into Django models. Gain knowledge about using Django Model APIs to manipulate objects in databases without writing SQL queries. Explore the many useful methods Django Model provides to handle related objects.
##### Learning Objectives
- Describe the difference between the SQL paradigm and the object-oriented programming paradigm
- Explain the core concepts of ORM
- List the pros and cons of ORM
- Explain the core concepts of Django ORM
- Convert your entity-relationship diagrams into Django models
- Perform CRUD operations on database objects using Django model APIs
- Access and delete related objects using Django Model APIs

### Week 3 - Full-stack Django Development

It’s time to build your skills by creating a Django web app. In this module, you’ll explore the Django Model- View- Template design pattern and learn how Django models, views, and templates work together to present data on a website. You’ll look at a typical Django development process, starting with building a Django project and creating and adding an app. Gain knowledge about the Django web app structure. Learn the steps to create Django models and views, add an HTML template, map the request URLs to your views, and design and build the UI. Next, use Django’s powerful admin site functionality to manage your site content. You’ll build an admin site and create an admin user. You’ll specify the model fields on the admin site and add UI features such as Search and Filter. Create a Django view to receive an HTTP request and send an HTTP response. Discover how to combine Django views and templates to present your data as dynamic web pages.
##### Learning Objectives
- Describe the Model-View-Controller pattern
- Describe the Django Model- View- Template pattern
- Describe the Django web app structure
- Create and run a simple Django web app
- Build an admin site to manage the content of an online course app
- Customize the admin site
- Create a Django view
- Combine Django views and templates to present your data
